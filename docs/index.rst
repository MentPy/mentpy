Welcome to MentPy's documentation
=================================

.. admonition:: Note
   :class: warning
   
   MentPy is currently in alpha and many features are still in development and may not work as expected.

The :obj:`mentpy` library is a Python package for simulating MBQC circuits. This library contains functions
to automatically calculate the causal flow or generalized flow of a graph, and deal with correction and 
byproduct operators in MBQC circuits. 


Features
--------

* Manipulation of graph states.
* Automatically calculate the causal flow or generalized flow of a graph.
* Simulate MBQC circuits.
* Optimize measurement angles in MBQC ansatzes used for QML.
* Create data and noisy data for training QML models.
* Determine the lie algebra of an MBQC ansatz.

Roadmap
-------
* Improve current simulators for MBQC circuits.
* Fix many bugs in the library üêõ.
* Improve tests on current functions.
* Add a tensor network simulator for MBQC circuits.
* Add support for more general MBQC states.
* Integrate with `pyzx` to optimize resources in MBQC circuits.
